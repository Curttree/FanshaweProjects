## By: Curtis Tremblay (Student Number: 1049697)


### Build Instructions
- In Visual Studio, build project in either x64 with either Debug or Release configuration (both options should work).

## Running the Project
- Controls are:
    - No input : Idle Animation
    - W/A/S/D : Walk
    - Shift + W/A/S/D : Run
    - Q / Don't press anything for  a while : Waiting Animation
    - Right Click : Aim
    - Left Click (while Aiming) : Shoot
- This submission is for both parts one and two of animation, as well as part two for physics. Animations blend when transitioning between each other.
- Character is controlled via a proxy rigid body object that has velocity applied to it directly.
- Raycasting is being used to determine if a shot connects with an object (specifically the various 'cans' set up throughout the scene)
