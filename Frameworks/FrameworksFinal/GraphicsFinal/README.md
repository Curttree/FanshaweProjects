# INFO 6028 - Graphics - Final Exam
## By: Curtis Tremblay (Student Number: 1049697)


### Build Instructions
- In Visual Studio, build project in x64 with either Release Debug configuration (both options should work, but Debug is slow due to my lack of optimizations).

## Running the Project / Notes

- Files for Question 1 are located inside the GraphicsFinal/Question1 folder
- Right Clicking on the screen allows you to toggle wireframes, and jump the camera nearby the stairs (as they are difficult to otherwise spot)
- You can also toggle between wireframe with the spacebar.
- The dungeon map is aligned such that you start toward the bottom left of the map, facing towards the right (if you are looking to find any points of interest in the dungeon)
- I did stick to a single ground model to due time constraints, however all other (non-bonus) instructions should be present.
