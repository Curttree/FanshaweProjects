# INFO 6044 - Game Engine Frameworks & Patterns - Final Exam
## By: Curtis Tremblay (Student Number: 1049697)


### Build Instructions
- In Visual Studio, build project in x64 with either Release or Debug configuration (Debug obviously runs a bit slower).

## Running the Project / Notes

- Press Space to start / fire your bullets, left and right arrow keys to move.
- I decreased the hitbox of the enemy missle to about a quarter of what is shown in the video, so it should be more accurate now.
- Fly camera is still available with the default controls. I wanted to provide the classic view, but you can also adjust the camera to show that it is indeed 3D.
