### Build Instructions
- In Visual Studio, build project in either x64 with either Debug or Release configuration (both options should work).
## Running the Project
- The camera can be set to a position that shows models and lighting for question 1 (at the end of the corridor) or questions 2-4 (inside the lab)
	- This is controlled via 1 or 2 on the keyboard, or by right clicking the window and selecting the appropriate option
	- The camera can also be dynamically controlled (as it is the provided fly cam).
- Space bar opens/closes the shutter door for question 4.
	- As a "safety" measure, you must wait for the doors to open/close completely before pressing the button again. If the doors are in motion, the button press will be ignored.
- There are a few marks that I definitely did not get, though I at least left remnants of my attempts at these marks.
	- At the very least these include:
		- BONUS: Filling in the space around the corridor entrance. Added a scaled down panel to cover most of the space, but my 3d modeling is not at a point where I am able to fill in the rest of the gap.
		- Making the four beakers transparent. Feel like I need to change the alpha value of the colour, but could not get it to work properly.
		- Rotating the light when the door is opening/closing. Added a light that turns on when the doors are opening/closing but it does not rotate.
